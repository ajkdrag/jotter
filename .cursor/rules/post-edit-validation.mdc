description: Always perform these tasks once you have done changes to the codebase

# Overview

Once you are done making any code changes and are about to finalize. Do the following tasks:
- Run `pnpm check` and fix any issues
- Verify TypeScript types. Use the linter's feedback
- See if you can simplify your implementation WITHOUT breaking the logic or the "requirement" that user proposed. Oversimplication will be penalized if it breaks existing code patterns and guidelines
- Remove docstrings, comments which are redundant
- Add tests in the right location (if we should), even if the user might have forgotten to ask you to create them
- Make sure files are always in snake_case
